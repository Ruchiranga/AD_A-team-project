# How to make an Oscar winning movie?

# Abstract
Nowadays, movies have become an integral part of entertainment in everyoneâ€™s life. Entertainment giants like Netflix and HBO are investing billions of dollars a year to produce high quality movies with the most popular actors and directors of the cinematographic industry for its audience. 

The goal of the project is to analyze the factors that contribute to the success of a movie through time. We intend to look into aspects including but not limited to the cast, the movie budget, writers and directors, time of first screening, genre and the IMDB rating of movies. The analysis can give us insights on the evolution of the interest of people towards movies with time. We will use datasets provided by IMDB and we will also use web scraping to obtain additional information required from imdb.com.

* Write code to scrape the required data from web and store them locally
* Prepare the final data sets by merging the scraped information with the existing datasets
### Data inspection and cleaning (to be completed by 8th November)
* Perform exploratory data analysis on the data to obtain a generic idea on the data as well as to identify any possible data issues
* Clean the data and prepare the dataset for analysis
### Data analysis and conclusions (to be completed by 25th November)
* Perform data analysis focussing on the mentioned research questions
